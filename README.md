## Scrapy Settings Highlights

- **Concurrent Requests**: 16 (for fast parallel scraping)
- **Per-Domain Concurrency**: 8 requests
- **AutoThrottle**: Enabled to prevent server overload
- **Download Timeout**: 15 seconds
- **Cookies**: Disabled for reduced overhead
- **Results Export**: Automatic JSON export to `results.json`

## Supported Websites

1. **Torob** (torob.com) - Price comparison platform
2. **Emalls** (emalls.ir) - Online shopping marketplace

## Notes

- The spider respects `robots.txt` rules
- CSS selectors include fallbacks for different page structures
- Prices are automatically cleaned and formatted
- Search queries are URL-encoded for safety
- The app clears previous results before each new search

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **No results found**: The website structure may have changed. Check the CSS selectors in `product_spider.py`
2. **Timeout errors**: Increase the timeout in `app.py` or reduce concurrent requests in `settings.py`
3. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Future Enhancements

- Add more Iranian e-commerce sites
- Implement price filtering and sorting
- Add product image display
- Create price history tracking
- Add export to Excel format
